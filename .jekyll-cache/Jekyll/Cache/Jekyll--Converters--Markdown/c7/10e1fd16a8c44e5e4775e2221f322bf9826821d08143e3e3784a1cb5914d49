The editor learned from the diary that the scientist, despite being mocked by his neighbour Abinashbabu was getting prepared for a voyage to Mars. He also invented a robot that he called <em>Bidhushekhar</em>. Later the Professor, along with <em>Bidhushekhar</em>, his servant Prahlad and his pet cat Newton, landed in Mars, where they were attacked by an army of Martians. They escaped from Mars and subsequently lost their way in space. After many days of wondering, they arrived in <em>Tafa</em>, an unknown planet inhabited by the “first civilised humans of the solar system.” Unlike the Martians, the inhabitants of <em>Tafa</em> welcomed the strangers in a hearty manner and made Professor Shonku their fellow citizen. The editor wanted to publish the journal in his magazine, but later copying the contents he found the diary was destroyed by a swarm of ants.</p>
