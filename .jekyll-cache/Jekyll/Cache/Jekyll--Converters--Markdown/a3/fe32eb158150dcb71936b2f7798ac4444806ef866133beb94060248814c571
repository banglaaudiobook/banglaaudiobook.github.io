<p>BanglaAudiobook.in, is an effort to bring to life the literary treasures of ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ (<em>Bengali</em>). This started out as a small effort to record the audio versions of my favorite stories and novels for my siblings. Their lack of interest to read <em>Bengali</em> literature and enjoy the stories I enjoyed as a child, pushed me to record the first <em>Bengali</em> Audiobook.</p>

<p>Though there are other websites for obtaining bengali audiobooks, but either they are not updated regularly, or their collection excludes the most popular and favorite bengali stories/novels. This was also a push at my initial idea execution stage.</p>

<p>Many of you might be interested in the setup I use to record my voice. Here‚Äôs the setup below:</p>

</ol>

<p>Also, I do not record in a sound-proof room. I just record in my room which has lot of soft surfaces, which dampens the sound.</p>
