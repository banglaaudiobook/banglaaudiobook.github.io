Hello there!

BanglaAudiobook.in, is an effort to bring to life the literary treasures of _Bengali_. This started out as a small effort to record the audio versions of my favorite stories and novels for my siblings. Their unability to read _Bengali_ and enjoy the stories I enjoyed as a child, pushed me to record the first story.

Though there are other websites for obtaining bengali audiobooks, but either they are not updated regularly, or their collection excludes the most popular and favorite bengali stories/novels. This was also a push at my initial idea execution stage.

Many of you might be interested in the setup I use to record my voice. Here's the setup below:

1. [Apple 27" iMAC](http://www.apple.com/in/imac/) / [Apple rMBP](http://www.apple.com/in/macbook-pro/)
2. [Blue Yeti Microphone](http://www.bluemic.com/products/yeti/)
3. [Apple Logic Pro X](http://www.apple.com/logic-pro/)
4. [Samson MK10 Lightweight Microphone Boom Stand](http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/accessories/microphone-stands/mk10/)

Also, I do not record in a sound-proof room. I just have my Air Conditioner running which generates a white noise which I can later removed.
